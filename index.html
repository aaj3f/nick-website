      <section class="about col-1">
        <p>Nicholas Wolters is Assistant Professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish & Italian. Before joining the faculty at Wake Forest, he earned his MA in Spanish and French from the University of Delaware (2011) and completed his PhD in Spanish at the University of Virginia (2016). His teaching and research interests include modern Spanish peninsular literature and visual cultures (18th-21st centuries), Catalan studies, gender theory, and television studies. His work on these and related topics appears or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed edited volumes and journals including Anales Galdosianos, Revista de Estudios Hisp치nicos, Hispan칩fila, Romance Notes and Decimon칩nica. </p>
        <p>His current book-length project (Fashioning the Spanish Bourgeois: Styles of Masculinity and the Nation in Alas, Gald칩s, Pereda, and Oller) explores the masculine poetics deployed by nineteenth-century novelists and visual artists, who use emblematic figures like the priest, the pauper, and the businessman to construct self-referential fictions of bourgeois identity and modernity.</p>
